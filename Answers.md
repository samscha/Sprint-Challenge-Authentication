1. _Describe Middleware, Sessions (as we know them in express), bcrypt and JWT._ **Middleware is code that acts between two enodpoints, such as receiving an HTTP request and doing something with that request. Examples can include authenticating, validating parsing an HTTP request before we do something and send a response. Sessions are just that, sessions a user/client can access the server for certains functions, such as accessing a user list. `bcrypt` is middleware that hash strings, such as passwords. JWT are tokens that can given to a client for _client side_ authentication of protected resources on a server.**
1. _What does bcrypt do in order to prevent attacks?_ **`bcrypt` hashes passwords (any sensitive data) that make the time to decrypt the password (sensitive data) implausible (100k+ years) at the current level of technology. In the future, computing power may dramatically increase which may require hashing to use longer characters (more possibilties) or an altogether different method.**
1. _What are the three parts of the JSON Web Token?_ **The three parts of JWT are: 1) header, 2) payload, and 3) signature. The header declares the type and hashing algorithm of the JWT. The payload is the data and includes registered, public, and private claims. And the signature contains the secret for validation.**
